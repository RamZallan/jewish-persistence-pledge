intro_paragraph: A Promise to Ourselves
item:
  - body: "**We, Jews in an anti-Black world, rejoice at the growing tide of Black
      resistance to white supremacy.** We include Black Jews and non-Black Jews,
      and we understand: Every victory for Black freedom is a victory for the
      future all human beings deserve."
  - body: "**When a movement this powerful arises, powerful tools will arise to stop
      it. History shows that antisemitism is such a tool.** Through both real
      incidents and false accusations, antisemitism works to tear apart
      movements for justice. It works to divide movements, and to distract from
      the original liberation issues being pursued; to make activists question
      whether they can trust one another; and to frighten Jews away from
      fighting with our whole hearts for these struggles."
  - body: "We have decided: **This time, we will be ready.**"
