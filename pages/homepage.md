**We, Jews in an anti-Black world, rejoice at the growing tide of Black resistance to white supremacy.** We include Black Jews and non-Black Jews, and we understand: This movement for Black liberation is a victory for the world. Every victory for Black freedom is a victory for the future all human beings deserve.
