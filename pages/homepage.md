intro_paragraph: A Promise to Ourselves
item:
  - body: "**We, Jews in an anti-Black world, rejoice at the growing tide of Black
      resistance to white supremacy.** We include Black Jews and non-Black Jews,
      and we understand: Every victory for Black freedom is a victory for the
      future all human beings deserve."
  - body: "**When a movement this powerful arises, powerful tools will arise to stop
      it. History shows that antisemitism is such a tool.** Through both real
      incidents and false accusations, antisemitism works to tear apart
      movements for justice. It works to divide movements, and to distract from
      the original liberation issues being pursued; to make activists question
      whether they can trust one another; and to frighten Jews away from
      fighting with our whole hearts for these struggles."
  - body: "We have decided: **This time, we will be ready.**"
  - body: "**We pledge to remain in this growing movement against white supremacy,
      even when real antisemitism happens** - as it will, because the most
      well-intentioned human beings are still learning, and all movements are
      works in progress. There will be real antisemitism. There will be
      incidents with gray areas which make us feel unsure. There will be false
      charges of antisemitism, designed by opponents of this movement to push
      our movements back, push our people out, and push us apart from our
      non-Jewish partners with whom we share this vision of change. When things
      get hard, we pledge to reach out to other Jews for strength, for creative
      solutions, and to support each other to stay in the movement."
  - body: "**We will be true to ourselves.** We will not be silent if antisemitism
      arises. We will support each other to address concerns about antisemitism
      thoughtfully and deliberately - without distracting from Black organizers’
      primary work, without targeting Black leaders, and without dividing
      ourselves from others. Our non-Jewish partners are worthy of our highest
      expectations. We will remember how capable our partners are of learning
      about and dismantling antisemitism, as we all rise together to meet the
      challenges of this moment."
  - body: "**We will see opportunities.** When the reality of danger to Jews today
      makes us feel that we cannot stay in coalition, we will push ourselves to
      look for new and deeper connections. We will become adept at recognizing
      not just who our allies are, but who can become our allies, treating other
      people's learning process with the generosity that every human deserves,
      and remembering that we can heal from hurtful words spoken in ignorance.
      We will build meaningful relationships with non-Jews in this work, knowing
      that it takes time for all people to hone our skills as allies, and we
      emerge from conflicts best when we are already invested in each other as
      individuals."
  - body: "**We can learn how to do this:** how to uproot antisemitism not by
      fighting or fleeing but by planting deep roots with other people, and
      uncovering the intertwined roots that already exist. We are Jews in an
      antisemitic world: far from fragile, and not easily shocked. Just as white
      Jews have participated in racism - sometimes knowingly and sometimes not -
      it is not surprising when non-Jews in any group show that they, too, have
      absorbed antisemitism. It is by staying in relationships, and forging them
      where they don’t yet exist, that we will learn and unlearn these things
      together."
  - body: "**We will defend Black activists** when charges of antisemitism are used
      to derail or silence the struggle for Black lives. We reject the idea that
      there is a special brand of “Black antisemitism.” Antisemitism is a
      systemic problem - we will not allow Black gentiles to be singled out for
      blame. We will defend ourselves against those who invalidate Black Jews’
      existence, or question any of our loyalty to ourselves as Jews."
  - body: "**We will bring our people with us.** We Jews who are not Black pledge to
      open this conversation with other non-Black Jews, inviting them into this
      pledge as a sign of our shared resolve: To stay together in this long-term
      commitment to fight white supremacy. We will resist the urge to give up on
      other Jews when we don’t agree. We will reach, with determination and
      compassion, to bring all Jews into this fight, where we all belong."
  - body: "**We will examine our own community with courage** - as many of us do
      already, speaking out about the racism and erasure we experience in many
      Jewish spaces, as Jews with Black, Indigenous, Mizrahi, Sephardi and
      non-European heritages."
  - body: For some of us - like those of us whose European ancestors were
      well-trained to notice the earliest signs of danger - this takes practice.
      When we hear Jews criticized, we feel a warning ring out inside us that we
      are alone, in danger, under attack. We may feel this when we hear Black
      non-Jews tell of encountering racism from white Jews; when we see people
      naming Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and non-European Israelis as
      racist. We may even feel this way when we witness the powerful solidarity
      between Jewish and non-Jewish Black Americans and Palestinians, as two
      peoples facing violent racism and dehumanizing state power.
  - body: When our fear of antisemitism threatens to make us shut down and turn
      away, we will decide to pause, to breathe, and to listen. **We have lived
      through our history with courage.** We can discuss it with courage too,
      and build a future where we are no longer fighting alone.
  - body: "**We are experts at persistence.** We have outlived empires. We have been
      blessed to make it to this moment; to witness the possibility of building
      a different kind of world: a world where we may all be free to be who we
      are. We see a future with Black liberation, and we know that the
      liberation of all Jews and all people lies on that path."
  - body: The struggle against antisemitism takes deep relationships. We will build
      them.
  - body: "**This is a promise to ourselves.**"
