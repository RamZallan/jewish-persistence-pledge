  “We have to keep our eyes on the prize, and stay in relationship with each other so that we can agitate and change each other, with love.”

  From Anti-Semitism: Why Is It Everyone’s Concern? (2017) - Cherie Brown and Amy Leos-Urbel

  “Let us work together with all who are committed to social justice to embrace a commitment to end anti-Semitism alongside all oppression. As a unified movement, no longer vulnerable to the divide-and-conquer politics of anti-Semitism, we will be more effective at fighting for the liberation of all peoples.”

  [The Past Didn’t Go Anywhere: Making Resistance to Antisemitism Part of All Of Our Movements](https://www.aprilrosenblum.com/thepast) (2007) - April Rosenblum


  “It would be an understatement to note that in the vast sweep of history, Jewish liberation has not exactly been a pet cause of the Right. So why have they gotten away with making fighting antisemitism into a noble Right-wing issue? …Whenever the Left is quiet about an issue that matters to people, it leaves a vacuum for the Right to walk into.”

  Essays:\

  [Dear White Jews: Stop Using My Existence As A Talking Point. Show Up, Instead.](https://blavity.com/dear-white-jews-stop-using-my-existence-as-a-talking-point?category1=feminism&category2=community-submitted) - Rachel Faulkner\

  “None of us win the battle against white supremacy alone, or in monolithic communities, and we do not win the battle against anti-Semitism without dismantling its catalyst: white supremacy, itself. None of us win this battle by staying at home. Staying at home is giving in to the oldest trick in the book of white supremacy — the tactic of divide and conquer. On the contrary, we all win this battle by showing up, by staying in dialogue, by working across lines of intersection. My Jewish family, I hope you’ll show up with me, my life depends on it — and your life, ultimately, depends on it, too. All of our lives depend on it.” 


  [Why JWOC (Jewish Women of Color) Are Marching](https://medium.com/jwocmarching/why-jwoc-are-marching-bbf142928a94) - Shoshana Brown\

  “This is the work of collective liberation. I can disagree with my Sister and work together to save our lives and the lives of our kin. We can check each other and work together to disempower white supremacy and white nationalism — but doing this work with any level of trust and authenticity requires us to tell the truth and deal with the mess between us. This is the healing work of restoration and renewal that is vital to getting free. This is warrior’s work.” - Tonda Case\

  [Jewish Women of Color Open Letter](https://medium.com/@shoshanabrwn/jewish-women-of-color-open-letter-3eb75fa6e87b) - Shoshana Brown


  “Jewish women of Color embrace our wisdom, self-expression, loving intentionality, creativity, humor, and essential roles in organizing spaces and in movement leadership. We resist the role of “translators” and invite the depth and breadth of our families and allies to join us in “Beloved Community” where critical thinking, knowledge sharing and popular education live alongside commitments to regular check-ins, restorative justice principles and the practice of healing and accountability. We are committed to learning from our elders and our history of activism. We resist perfectionism as a leadership model and firmly reject disposability as an option. We are not here to throw any of our leaders away.” 


  The current state of antisemitism in the US


  [Being a Jew When There Are Swastikas in the Street](https://djctoronto.com/jew-swastikas-street/) - Rabbi Miriam Margles


  “I want us to talk about what it’s like to be a Jew right now, so that we don’t become numb or isolated in fear, so that we are awake to the specific ways these events are hitting us.  I want to remind us that this is NOT Germany in 1933.  We have allies and friends within our community and beyond it.  The world is different today than it was then.  I also want us to have a better understanding of the ways that anti-Semitism functions differently than most other forms of oppression and bigotry so that we can see it more clearly and stand against it alongside working to eradicate all forms of hatred and oppression.”

  [HowToFightAntisemitism.com: What is Fueling Antisemitism?](https://www.howtofightantisemitism.com/home#home-resources) - [Bend the Arc: Jewish Action](https://www.bendthearc.us/) and Jews Against White Nationalism


  “Far-right extremists who have taken over the GOP rely on fear and division to maintain power. They use antisemitism to fuel that fear and division, putting Jews and our neighbors in danger. The danger is real: Donald Trump’s presidency has coincided with an uptick in hate crimes and violence, including the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.”


  ​


  # [Taking Aim at Multiracial Democracy](https://www.politicalresearch.org/2019/10/22/taking-aim-multiracial-democracy) - Ben Lorber “We must understand the threat of White nationalist antisemitism animating today’s Right \[—]and we must interrupt this totalizing, conspiratorial antisemitic narrative with a bold, expansive vision of real, inclusive, feminist, multiracial democracy in which everyone can thrive."

  [In Trump's America, the Jewish High Holidays Mean Waiting for the Next Synagogue Attack](https://www.newsweek.com/antisemitism-usa-trump-white-nationalism-not-rashida-tlaib-ilhan-omar-1462396) - Sophie Ellman-Golan\

  “We have reason to be afraid: anti-Semitism is real and continues to rise in frequency and magnitude alike. Yet despite the insistence of Jewish institutions and high-profile centrist Jewish journalists that the threat facing American Jews is coming from "both sides," I had no anxiety about a campus BDS activist or Muslim congresswoman walking into my synagogue and opening fire. The attack I feared—the attacks that have already devastated our community and others'— is coming from white nationalists who have been emboldened and embraced by right-wing media and the Republican Party... \[I]n an era where truth loses value daily, facts have to matter. We have to know tweeting song lyrics is not the same as inciting a mass murder. We have to know if we are to fight for ourselves, our safety, our dignity—and that of our neighbors.” 


  [Skin in the Game: How Antisemitism Animates White Nationalism](https://www.politicalresearch.org/2017/06/29/skin-in-the-game-how-antisemitism-animates-white-nationalism) - Eric Ward


  “Antisemitism, I discovered, is a particular and potent form of racism so central to White supremacy that Black people would not win our freedom without tearing it down.”

  [The Right Wants to Keep Jewish and Black Non-Jewish Communities Divided. We Can’t Let That Happen](https://medium.com/@DoveKent/the-right-wants-to-keep-jewish-and-black-non-jewish-communities-divided-we-cant-let-that-happen-4b79a86d66bc) - Ben Lorber, Dove Kent & Leo Ferguson


  “Jews and allies have drawn thousands to demonstrations following separate antisemitic attacks by members of Black communities against orthodox Jews in Jersey City, Crown Heights, and Monsey. The White nationalist movement, meanwhile, has applied antisemitism and racism to strategically exploit tensions between Jewish and non-Jewish Black communities in service of their broader goal of White racial dominance."

  Black Jews & Jews of Color


  ​


  [Jews of Color: Race and Afro-Jewishness](https://backdoorbroadcasting.net/2018/06/lewis-gordon-jews-of-colour-race-and-afro-jewishness/) (audio lecture) - Lewis Gordon


  "The first thing I have to say is: There's nothing remarkable about being Black and Jewish; nothing remarkable at all. However, something has happened to the world that has made it such that it's treated as something unusual."​

  ‘Believe us’: Black Jews respond to the George Floyd protests, in their own words - Josefin Dolsten


  “I also want to see the Jewish community embrace radical possibility...There are solutions of varying radicalness that black folks have been proposing for years to right the systemic wrongs of a nation that black people built: reparations; universal basic income; mass decarceration; defunding police. Hammers and nails won’t be enough to build what must come next for us all to thrive — we need bulldozers and forklifts. Embrace the radical possibility, and help make it true.” - Ginna Green 


  ‘As a Jew of Color, I Need More People in My Community to Speak Up’- Danielle Ziri


  “\[April Baskin] believes the trauma Jews have experienced over generations with antisemitism needs to be discussed more in the framework of race, and that Jews should have a “safe and brave space where they can really unpack stuff and go deep.” She adds: “Jews have that consciousness of being afraid of rocking the boat, being afraid of doing things that black people need. I need, as a Jew of color, for more of the people in my community to speak up – because it’s not enough.”


  ​


  [Not Free to Desist: Re-Imagining Our Collective Jewish Covenant](https://www.notfreetodesist.org/) - an open letter to Jewish institutions


  "We acknowledge that this is not the first time that Jewish communities have been called in to address concerns regarding racism, inequity, and inclusivity. We give thanks to the organizations and individuals who have been carrying this mantle for decades. Furthermore, we give love to the many incredible individual Black Jews of Color, Non-Black Jews of Color, and allies who have been deeply committed to addressing racial justice in the Jewish community. While we honor and acknowledge the significant investments towards racial justice from many Jewish institutions, we are calling in the Jewish institutional community to challenge ourselves to dream big."

  [Transcending Jewish Trauma (a map of internalized antisemitism)- Jo Kent Katz](https://entirelytalia.wordpress.com/2015/06/17/a-call-to-my-beloved-jews-we-gotta-talk-about-privilege/?fbclid=IwAR1Jz0iPUzlppIfzw37YaD74X_64VOzsanD-mcSnHo2zFZrhvBdBI0aeUtQ)


  [“The resources offered here directly address the personal, collective, and ancestral trauma and internalized oppression of assimilated, white Ashkenazi Jews living in the U.S., with the intention of healing and transforming our Jewish institutions, organizations, congregations, and communities.”](https://entirelytalia.wordpress.com/2015/06/17/a-call-to-my-beloved-jews-we-gotta-talk-about-privilege/?fbclid=IwAR1Jz0iPUzlppIfzw37YaD74X_64VOzsanD-mcSnHo2zFZrhvBdBI0aeUtQ)

  [A Call to My Beloved Jews: We Gotta Talk About Privilege](https://entirelytalia.wordpress.com/2015/06/17/a-call-to-my-beloved-jews-we-gotta-talk-about-privilege/?fbclid=IwAR1Jz0iPUzlppIfzw37YaD74X_64VOzsanD-mcSnHo2zFZrhvBdBI0aeUtQ) - Talia Cooper


  “Anti-Semitism is real. White privilege is real. Racism is real. These things are linked, but they are not all the same and cannot be compared. Sometimes it makes sense to focus on one while not abandoning the other, and at this moment in U.S history, I see way too many murders of black people to stand idly by. When I say Black Lives Matter, this in no way negates my commitment to ending anti-Semitism. It is not about oppression hierarchies, though we do need to examine the fact that this country was economically built on racism. Ultimately, I believe our liberation is connected. So let’s get to work.”

  "Black-Jewish relations,"* past & present


  [600+ Jewish Organizations and Synagogues say: Black Lives Matter](https://medium.com/@jewishorgssayblacklivesmatter/majority-of-american-jews-in-full-page-new-york-times-ad-unequivocally-black-lives-matter-60ae44e7c305) - full-page New York Times ad on the anniversary of the March on Washington


  "We are Jewish organizations and synagogues from across the racial and political spectrum; from different streams of Judaism; whose members trace their lineage from countries around the world. We speak with one voice when we say, unequivocally: Black Lives Matter."


  ​


  [Negroes Are Anti-Semitic Because They're Anti-White](https://movies2.nytimes.com/books/98/03/29/specials/baldwin-antisem.html) - James Baldwin


  "One does not wish, in short, to be told by an American Jew that his suffering is as great as the American Negro's suffering. It isn't, and one knows that it isn't from the very tone in which he assures you that it is. ...In the American context, the most ironical thing about Negro anti-Semitism is that the Negro is really condemning the Jew for having become an American white man--for having become, in effect, a Christian. ...He is singled out by Negroes not because he acts differently from other white men, but because he doesn't."


  ​


  [Black Antisemitism Is Not Inherently “Left-Wing”](https://jewishcurrents.org/black-antisemitism-is-not-inherently-left-wing/) - Rebecca Pierce


  “A poorly defined concept of 'Black antisemitism' not only risks promulgating racist stereotypes about African Americans—treating us as inherently violent, criminal, and irrational—but also obscures the specifics of the various ways antisemitism can manifest, making it harder for us to fight back. ...The violent ideology of the Jersey City shooters reflects centuries of history in which Black and Jewish communities have been divided and pitted against each other under a system that harms us all.”
